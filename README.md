# Quebec VaxiCode Tracker

A simple history tracker for the public JSON file used by Quebec's VaxiCode applications to verify vaccination status.

## Covered period

The tracker starts with the very first public version at the time of the release in October 2021, but it's missing all updates between that point and January 2022. However, it should be able to track all new updates from that point onward.

## Reading the file

Parsing the file and explaining its content is beyond the scope of this repository. JSON is a human-readable format, but some parts of it are not immediately clear.

## Intention

This tool has no ill intents, it simply contains a copy of the publicly hosted file so that its change history can be easily navigated. If you work for the Government and think this should not exist, please contact me.
